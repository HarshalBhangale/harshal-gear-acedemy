# Pebble Game Assignment - harshal-gear-acedemy

This assignment involves implementing a simple two-player game called the Pebble Game. The rules of the game are as follows:

- **Players**: There are two players: the User and the Program.
- **Starting Player**: The first player is chosen randomly.
- **Starting Pebbles**: The game begins with a certain number of pebbles, denoted as `N` (e.g., `N=15`).
- **Turns**: On each player's turn, they must remove between 1 and `K` pebbles from the pile (e.g., if `K=2`, the player can remove 1 or 2 pebbles per turn).
- **Winning Condition**: The player who takes the last pebble(s) wins the game.

## Objectives

- **Random Start**: Implement a mechanism to choose the starting player randomly.
- **User Interaction**: Allow the user to input the number of pebbles they want to remove on their turn.
- **Program Logic**: Implement the program's turn logic to ensure a fair game.
- **Winning Condition**: Determine and announce the winner when the last pebble is taken.
